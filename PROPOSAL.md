# Magic To-Do List

## Description and Motivation

For this project, we are building an automated To-Do List with an incentive of asking the Magic 8 Ball a question at the end. In this project, we will be using a countdown, input/ output to insert a list of tasks to be done, as well as the main function of Magic 8 Ball. This particular project differs from a normal to-do list by using a countdown to maintain the length of time every task needs to be completed in. It also adds a bonus "fun" of getting to use a Magic 8 Ball question. With normal to-do lists, not everybody is motivated to complete all tasks every day. With this idea, you will have the motivation to want to finish all your tasks as that time is counting down as well as getting the fun to use a Magic 8 Ball. I mean, who doesn't like asking Magic 8 Ball questions? 

## Prior Art

Many apps similar to this idea already exist. Google Calendar , Tick Tick, and Notion use different methods of keeping track and reminders of what needs to be done. The basic concept of these apps is to keep a virtual tab on what needs to be done in your own life. Our proposal differs from the rest by providing a timer to get things done rather than setting a time yourself. In Google Calendar, the app is set up to remind you an event or task at a given time in a given day. Google Calendar allows you to set your appointments in a virtual Calendar. The Tick Tick also serves as a virtual reminder. Magic To-Do is set up to check things off in a To-Do list while running a countdown. We chose to include Magic 8 Ball's questioning to make the project a combination of both technical and gaming. 

## Core User Workflows

- The user enters the tasks needed to be done.
- The user then uses the command 'Shake' to start the countdown process.
    - This command opens up to the input required to answer "Enter the time in minutes: ".
- As the countdown continues, it is the user's responsibility to enter each task that would be completed to "check it off the list".
- Once time is up, the system notifies the User and produces a list of what was not done. If all tasks were completed, the Magic 8 Ball is shown.
- User asks the Magic 8 Ball a yes or no question.
- **What is not included:**
    - This program will not include a reminder to show when something is need to be completed.

## Daily Goals

**Tuesday: A user should be able to start a countdown.**

Complete Countdown function to use minutes and display [hours] : [minutes] : [seconds]. 

**Wednesday: User should be able to input the tasks in the to-do list and the Magic 8-ball questioning.** 

Complete IO functions for "Enter what tasks you would like to complete" and "Ask Magic 8-Ball a Question"

**Thursday: User should be able to use all functions together.**

Everything should begin to tie up and work together. User should be able to enter tasks for the day first, then command shake to start countdown process, enter what tasks to check off, print tasks failed to be completed once timer stops, and if everything is checked off, produce the Magic 8-Ball.
