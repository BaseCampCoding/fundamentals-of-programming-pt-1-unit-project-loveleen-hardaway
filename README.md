# MagicCheck

MagicCheck is a Python Program that assigns you a 'task' with a timer. 

## Usage

When running the program, it will give you a set of directions to start off. It should ask you how many tasks you would like to complete followed by what all you would like to get done. 
These tasks that you state are stored in a virtual "to-do list". Once you are done adding items, the Magic 8 Ball part of the program shakes to choose a random task. 
You are allowed to choose between seconds or minutes for your countdown. Once you input the time and minutes/ seconds, the program will ask you to start it. 
After countdown is over, it will ask you if you were able to complete your task. If you were able to, you may proceed onto either doing another task or leaving it. 
If you were not able to, the program gives you the option of either doing the task again or leaving. 
As you go through different tasks, the program will keep track of which task has been done the fastest. 
Once you are done or ready to leave, it will send you off with a "See you later!"

## Technical Work

The program uses various functions of Python. 
It uses the built-in modules of random and time. Lists, for-loops, while-loops, input validation loops, and nested if statements are among the various functions used. 
We were also able to design our own functions to make the code succinct. 

## Purpose
The basic purpose of this program is to allow users a different approach to getting tasks done. 
There are various apps that are similar to MagicCheck. However, MagicCheck differs by incorporating a game of Magic 8-ball into it. This hopefully gives users the desire to want to bring productiveness.
There is definitely room for improvement looking at which bug could be there each time. Pull requests are most welcome as we would like to grow.
